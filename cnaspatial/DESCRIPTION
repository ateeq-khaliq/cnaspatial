Description: A pipeline for analyzing copy number alterations (CNAs) in spatial 
    transcriptomics data, with a focus on functional signatures such as hypoxia and 
    proliferation. This package provides tools for categorizing spots based on gene 
    expression signatures, visualizing CNAs in relation to these categories, and 
    generating comprehensive reports of genomic alterations.
